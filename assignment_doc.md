
**Frontend Assignment — Real-Time Collaborative Whiteboard**

  
  

**Problem Statement—**

  

Create a web application using React that allows users to upload images and receive real-time predictions from a pre-trained machine learning model. The application should be able to classify the uploaded images into multiple categories.

  

**Minimum Requirements—**

- Users can create a new whiteboard session or join an existing one.

- The whiteboard should support drawing using different colors and brush sizes.

- Implement the ability to undo/redo the last action on the whiteboard.

- Users should be able to see the cursors of other connected users moving in real-time, indicating their drawing actions.

- Add an option to save the whiteboard content as an image or PDF file.

- Implement authentication (user signup and login) to ensure that only authorized users can access the whiteboard.

- The application should be responsive and work on both desktop and mobile devices.

 
**Must have—**

- Use React for front-end development.

- The UX should look professional – see any white boarding tool from Microsoft for UX reference – bad ux choices will have negative points

- For real-time functionality, consider using WebSocket or a real-time database like PostGres SQL via a docker container.

- For drawing on the whiteboard, you can explore libraries like Fabric.js or Konva.js.

- Implement secure authentication using a backend service of keycloak only. Please use keycloak via a docker. User should only be allowed on home screen after login

- Clean & fluidic layout – use bootstrap (5.0) only

- Code must be written in **TypeScript only**, no JS code will be accepted

- Error-free, **Readable, Simple & Clean code**

- Let me stress the previous point - **Readable, Simple & Clean code**

  

**Bonus Points—**

  

- Allow users to collaborate through live chat while drawing on the whiteboard.

- Implement an invitation system, where users can invite others to join their whiteboard session via email.

- Add the ability to export the whiteboard content as a video with a playback of the drawing actions.

  

**Quick Hint—**

  

You can use local storage to save the user preferences.
